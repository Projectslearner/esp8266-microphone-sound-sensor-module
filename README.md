# ESP8266 Microphone Sound Sensor Module Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller with a microphone sound sensor module to detect sound levels in the environment. The analog output of the sound sensor module is read by the ESP8266, allowing it to monitor and display sound intensity through the Serial Monitor. This can be applied in various applications where sound detection and monitoring are essential.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Microphone Sound Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Microphone Sound Sensor Module to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the sound sensor module to analog pin A0 on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure proper power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections between the ESP8266 and the sound sensor module.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Operation:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600).
   - The Serial Monitor will display the sound sensor value in real-time, indicating the detected sound intensity.

#### Applications
- **Noise Monitoring:** Monitor ambient noise levels in various environments.
- **Voice-Activated Systems:** Use in projects requiring voice command recognition.
- **Sound-Triggered Events:** Trigger events based on sound thresholds.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Sensitivity:** Adjust the sensitivity of the sound sensor module as needed.
- **Analog Output:** The sound sensor module outputs an analog voltage proportional to the sound level.
- **Calibration:** Consider calibration based on the environment and noise sources for accurate readings.
